# Emotion-detection-synthetic-dataset
Creating an Emotion Recognition Synthetic Dataset with Python & Stable Diffusion | Image generation
This project explores synthetic emotion detection using Stable Diffusion, a cutting-edge generative AI framework. The implementation generates synthetic visuals and analyzes emotions within them using advanced deep learning techniques.

Description
The repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Main.ipynb) that demonstrates the following:

Stable Diffusion Integration: Leveraging the Stable Diffusion model to create synthetic images based on specific prompts.
Emotion Detection: Employing machine learning models to analyze and detect emotions in the generated synthetic images.
Pipeline Highlights:
Generate realistic synthetic visuals using text-based prompts.
Detect emotional characteristics from these visuals.
Combine generative AI with emotional AI for creative insights.
